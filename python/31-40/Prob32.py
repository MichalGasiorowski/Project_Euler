##We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it
##makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example,
##the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
##
##The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
##containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
##
##Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
##identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
##HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way
##so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
